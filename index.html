    <p>IDP Students learned to create websites from scratch using<br>

  <h1>The Process</h1>
  <p>It all starts with an idea. Students are given a concept to base a website on, and from<br>
    there they follow a workflow that allows them to quickly create visually stunning and<br>
     highly functional websites.</p>

<!-- Create a section with four steps -->
<section id="steps">
  <div class="content-container">
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 1: Brainstorm</div>
      <div class="step-description">This is where it all begins. Bringing together ideas, sketching out initial wireframe plans, and thinking of how to include all the necessary content. Brainstorming is a crucial step, and the rest of the project is based on what you come up with at this stage.</div>
      <img class="step-image" src="images/about-desktop.jpg" alt="Step 1 Image">
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 2: Wireframe</div>
      <div class="step-description">Usually you start off with a sketch of how you want the website to look. From there you bring this into Adobe XD and create a "low-fidelity" wireframe, without colours or pictures. As you gain more content, the colours and photos get filled in until you have exactly what you want your site to look like ready to reference.</div>
      <img class="step-image" src="images/about-desktop.jpg" alt="Step 2 Image">
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 3: Code</div>
      <div class="step-description">Once your wireframe is ready, you create a GitHub file for your website, create all the needed folders and files, and then the coding begins. We use 3 main languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        We start by creating the structure with HTML and a CSS grid, add function with JS, and finally we style it with CSS. After all this is done we run it through a validator to ensure a bug-free site.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 4: Content</div>
      <div class="step-description">This can be done before, after, or during coding, depending on the available time and the amount of people working on the project. This step is the creation and preparation of content for the website. Photography and videography, designing, and editing of this content are all done in this step.</div>
